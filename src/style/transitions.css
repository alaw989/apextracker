/**
 * Vue Transition Animation Classes
 *
 * This file contains shared transition animations for Vue's <Transition> and <TransitionGroup> components.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Import this file ONLY in components that use transitions. Do NOT import in base.css
 * to avoid loading unused CSS and to keep transitions co-located with their usage.
 *
 * Performance: All animations use only transform and opacity properties for GPU-accelerated,
 * 60fps animations. No layout properties (width, height, padding, etc.) are animated.
