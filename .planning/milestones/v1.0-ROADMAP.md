# Milestone v1.0: Apex Tracker MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 19

## Overview

Vue SPA rewrite of the existing React stat lookup application. The roadmap progressed from core functionality (search, display stats) through visual polish (dynamic backgrounds, animations), to SEO enablement (shareable URLs, meta tags), and finally performance optimization (caching, asset optimization). Each phase delivers a verifiable increment of value.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Lookup

**Goal**: Players can search for Apex Legends stats and see their rank, avatar, kills, and favorite legends in a Vue SPA.

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

**Requirements**: CORE-01, CORE-02, CORE-03, CORE-04, CORE-06, UX-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can enter a username, select a platform (Xbox/PSN/PC), and search for their stats
2. User sees their player rank icon, avatar, and overview stats (kills, wins, etc.)
3. User sees their top 2 legends by kills with the favorite legend visually highlighted
4. User sees a helpful error message when the player is not found (invalid username or no data)
5. User sees a loading indicator while data is being fetched

**Plans**: 6 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Initialize Vue 3 + Vite project with Pinia state management and design system foundation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Create utility functions, constants, and assets needed for API integration and platform selection
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Build the search interface with username input, platform selector, and search button
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Implement API integration with Tracker.gg to fetch player stats via Heroku proxy
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Create player stats display components: player header, overview stats list, and favorite legends
- [x] 01-06-PLAN.md — Add loading and error states for the search and display flow

### Phase 2: Visual Polish

**Goal**: The app feels polished with dynamic backgrounds that react to the player's favorite legend and smooth stat card animations.

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Requirements**: CORE-05, UX-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Background changes dynamically based on the player's favorite legend (each legend has unique themed background)
2. Stat cards animate smoothly when appearing (fade/slide transitions)
3. Animations replay cleanly when searching for a new player

**Plans**: 2 plans in 1 wave

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Dynamic background system tied to favorite legend with Vue Transition crossfade
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Stat card transition animations using Vue Transition and TransitionGroup components

### Phase 3: SEO & Sharing

**Goal**: Players can share their stats via URL and the app is discoverable through search engines and social media.

**Depends on**: Phase 2

**Requirements**: SEO-01, SEO-02, SEO-03, SEO-04, UX-01

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can share their stats via a URL containing username and platform (e.g., /player/username/pc)
2. Page structure uses semantic HTML (header, main, nav) for search crawlers
3. Page has descriptive title and meta description for each profile view
4. App displays correctly on mobile devices (responsive layout)

**Plans**: 7 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Vue Router 4 integration with shareable profile URLs (/player/:username/:platform)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Dynamic page titles using VueUse useTitle() for SEO
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Semantic HTML structure for search crawlers
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Mobile responsive styling foundations with 768px breakpoint
- [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — ShareButton component with clipboard integration
- [x] 03-06-PLAN.md — Schema.org structured data and accessibility improvements
- [x] 03-07-PLAN.md — Component-specific mobile refinements

### Phase 4: Performance

**Goal**: The app loads quickly and makes efficient use of the Tracker.gg API to avoid rate limits.

**Depends on**: Phase 3

**Requirements**: PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03, UX-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Repeated searches for the same player use cached data (no redundant API calls)
2. Page loads in under 2 seconds on a typical connection
3. Images (rank icons, avatars, legend art) are lazy-loaded
4. Production build assets are minified and compressed

**Plans**: 3 plans in 2 waves

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — API response caching with stale-while-revalidate pattern
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Lazy loading for images using IntersectionObserver
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Build optimization with code splitting and bundle analysis

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Vue 3 + Vite 6 chosen for modern development experience and fast builds
- Pinia over Vuex for simpler Composition API integration
- Plain JavaScript (no TypeScript) to match existing codebase pattern
- Vue Router history mode (not hash) for clean shareable URLs
- Stale-while-revalidate caching pattern for optimal UX with API rate limit protection
- esbuild minifier for 20-40x faster builds vs terser
- Manual code splitting (vue-vendor chunk) for long-term browser caching
- 768px breakpoint standardized across all mobile responsive components
- 44px minimum touch targets for WCAG 2.5.5 compliance

**Requirements Delivered (17/17):**

**Core Lookup** (6/6):
- ✓ CORE-01: User can search for player by username
- ✓ CORE-02: User can select platform (Xbox, PSN, PC)
- ✓ CORE-03: User sees player rank, avatar, and overview stats
- ✓ CORE-04: User sees top 2 legends by kills with favorite legend highlighted
- ✓ CORE-05: Background changes dynamically based on favorite legend
- ✓ CORE-06: User sees helpful error message when player not found

**User Experience** (4/4):
- ✓ UX-01: App is fully responsive on mobile devices
- ✓ UX-02: Page loads in under 2 seconds on typical connection
- ✓ UX-03: Smooth animations for stat card transitions
- ✓ UX-04: Loading indicator during data fetch

**SEO & Discoverability** (4/4):
- ✓ SEO-01: Each profile has shareable URL with username/platform
- ✓ SEO-02: Meta tags for social sharing (OG tags)
- ✓ SEO-03: Semantic HTML structure for search crawlers
- ✓ SEO-04: Descriptive page titles and meta descriptions

**Performance** (3/3):
- ✓ PERF-01: API responses are cached to reduce redundant calls
- ✓ PERF-02: Static assets are optimized (minified, compressed)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed missing `ref` import in PlayerHeader.vue
- Fixed duplicate usePageTitle initialization in main.js
- Fixed race condition in useLazyImage checkViewport with null guard

**Technical Debt Deferred:**
- CSS variable naming inconsistency (TimestampBadge/RefreshButton use --color- prefix instead of defined --text-/--bg- variables) — LOW severity, deferred to v2

**Stats:**
- 4 phases, 19 plans, ~82 minutes execution time
- ~4,542 lines of Vue/JavaScript code
- ~35+ files created/modified
- ~16 hours calendar time (2026-02-04 23:04 → 2026-02-05 14:48)
- Production bundle: ~55KB gzipped total transfer
