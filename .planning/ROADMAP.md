# Roadmap: Apex Tracker

## Overview

Vue SPA rewrite of the existing React stat lookup application. The roadmap progresses from core functionality (search, display stats) through visual polish (dynamic backgrounds, animations), to SEO enablement (shareable URLs, meta tags), and finally performance optimization (caching, asset optimization). Each phase delivers a verifiable increment of value.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
